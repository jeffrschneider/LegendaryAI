Plame was a covert agent. This is a fact. Let's don't argue about a simple fact.
You mean except no one was charged with outing an agent and her name was in the public domain and half of Washington knew who she was.... I guess "covert" is one of those words that doesn't mean what it actually means. NEXT---
Here's another fact: the Reagan administration broke the law in aiding the Contras. Congress forbade the aid, the Reagan administration went against the direct will of Congress.
1) So what?
2) The Boland Amendment, which was what was broken here, had no criminal penalty or enforcement procedures.
3) Bonus cut- The Boland Amendment only forbade budget funds from going to the contras. It did not forbid the profits of other ventures from going to them.
Which is why no one was actually ever charged with sending arms to the Contras. They were charged with things like "lying to Congress" when Congress knew damned well what was going on.
I'm shocked that there's gambling going on here!
And another: mining the harbors in Nicaragua was an act of war. The harbor was secretly mined, no one was told, and when Barry Goldwater found out about it, he tore Reagan administration officials a new one.
Wasn't this when Barry was also claiming he believed in UFO's? Who cared what that senile old jerk thought at that point.
You can thump your chest and pretend that you like the President to break the law. But you can't pretend that what the Bush administration did, or what the Reagan administration did, was legal.
And if my dad was the guy who had a gun held to his head by a crazed Jihadi, I wouldn't care that Reagan did something "illegal" to save his life. Nor would you.
This is our system of government, under the USC. Have you heard of it?
And the Congress was free to impeach. Oh, but wait, they didn't do that! Because they weren't going to go out and impeach a president for not letting the commies win.
The judge accepted Fitzgerald's evidence that Plame was covert.
But again, no one was charged with that.
Cute, but stupid. The CIA is the authority on their agents. If they say she's covert, she's covert.
So if they shoot you and say you were an enemy spy, you'd take that on face value, too?
Her name being in Who's Who is irrelevant. Deal with the reality here. Her name was known. That she was a covert agent was not.
Except half of Washington knew she worked at the CIA and she was pulled out of Russia because the Russians knew who she was.
Jackie Gingrich, Newt and his first wife's daughter, however have refuted the story of him "divorcing his wife when she was battling cancer". Jackie said--I'm thinking in a Larry King interview but can't remember for sure--that it was her mother who requested the divorce and the tumor was benign, not cancer. He did start dating Marriane before the divorce was final and was cheating on Marianne when he confessed that infidelity.
However those who condemn Newt's personal life, which was pretty scuzzy, don't seem to have a problem with President Clinton's affair with Gennifer Flowers, various other 'bimbo eruptions, and getting blow jobs in the Oval Office and don't seem to think that impaired his ability to preside.
So either there is a huge double standard at play here or Newt's infidelities don't matter either.
How about it?
Republicans are the preacher party. So Republicans have to live up to that.
Republicans are the bulk of the ones who claimed that Clinton's infidelities mattered. I know a few Democrats spoke out against him but they were few and far between. I personally think that if Hyde hadn't rushed the matter through the House there might have been more time for some of the more serious allegations to be substantiated and for other people who had been keeping silent to speak up. There might even have been official rape charges to contend with, not just rumors. But Hyde did rush it. And basically the Republicans looked mean for it, so they justly have to carry extra baggage around with them when they transgress traditional mores.
Eneeeway... some people do object to both Gingrich and Clinton.
But it's not necessarily an incorrect double standard to condemn one and not the other. Republicans are the ones who said it mattered. If you live by the sword, you die by the sword.
Democrats can have their Clintons and their Weiners and move on from it more quickly than we can. It's just plain not the indictment of their party which Republican cheaters are of ours.
I am one who said the infidelities did not affect Clinton's ability to president any more than it affected FDR or JFK that we KNOW fooled around and some others for whom there are suspicions. And while I do not condone anybody cheating on his/her spouse, and do think it calls their character into question, I am nevertheless fully qualified to comment on the reverse hypocrisy when Democrats didn't condemn their own but hold Republicans to a higher standard. Most especially when they have repeatedly accused us of condemning Clinton for the 'blow jobs' instead of the actual offenses.
